# HeavyTrafficIndicators
In this project, we're going to analyze a datset about the traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway, which connects the Great Lakes and northern Great Plain regions of the United States, running from Michigan to Montana.

Our goal is to find some indicators of heavy traffic on I-94 by using traffic volume data made available by John Hogue, you can find the original dataset and the data dictionary on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
